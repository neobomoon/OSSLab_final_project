### 2. How did I get started?
Discord is one of the most used interactive platforms among men in their 20s. Also, while playing games with friends of the same age, we have many conversations through Discord. At this time, if someone wants to go see a movie, we have to go to the cinema site, check the screening schedule, and make an appointment. While I was always thinking about how to reduce such cumbersome work, I had to decide on a topic for the final project of OSSLab, so I decided to use this as a topic.

### 3. How useful it is, who uses it
Imagine you are playing a game while communicating with your friends on Discord. However, I lost interest in the game because I played it too much. At this time, someone made an opinion to watch an interesting movie, and then imagine that you can get movie information, timetable, and information on the remaining seats right away through the Discord chatbot. What a convenient feature this is.

### 4. How to use
+ If you input 'movie' in Korean into the chatbot called 'movie lover', you can find out the titles of the movies currently playing at cgv in Bukpohang.

+ If you re-enter the title of the movie you want to see into the chatbot, you can see the number of seats remaining and the screening schedule.

### 5. Caution
+ The 56th line of the final.py file is using a meaningless token value because there is a risk of hacking. (The token running in the actual Raspberry Pi is set correctly.)

### 6. Improvements
+ In order to provide more diverse information by receiving input by region.
+ To make it more convenient by providing a url address where you can make a reservation.
+ To be able to provide a brief synopsis and rating of the movie as well.
